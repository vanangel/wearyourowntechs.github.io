                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Privacy Policy:
<br>Wear Your Own Techs ("Wear Your Own Techs") operates wearyourowntechs.com and may operate other websites. It is Wear Your Own Techs policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
<br>
<br>Website Visitors
<br>Like most website operators, Wear Your Own Techs collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wear Your Own Techs purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wear Your Own Techs visitors use its website. From time to time, Wear Your Own Techs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
<br>
<br>Wear Your Own Techs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on wearyourowntechs.com blogs/sites. Wear Your Own Techs only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
<br>
<br>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
<br>Certain visitors to Wear Your Own Techs websites choose to interact with Wear Your Own Techs in ways that require Wear Your Own Techs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Wear Your Own Techs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at wearyourowntechs.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Wear Your Own Techs are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Wear Your Own Techs collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Wear Your Own Techs. Wear Your Own Techs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
<br>
<br>Aggregated Statistics
<br>Wear Your Own Techs may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Wear Your Own Techs may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Wear Your Own Techs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
<br>
<br>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
<br>Wear Your Own Techs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Wear Your Own Techs behalf or to provide services available at Wear Your Own Techs websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Wear Your Own Techs websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Wear Your Own Techs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Wear Your Own Techs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Wear Your Own Techs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Wear Your Own Techs, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Wear Your Own Techs website and have supplied your email address, Wear Your Own Techs may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Wear Your Own Techs and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Wear Your Own Techs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
<br>
<br>Cookies

Wear Your Own Techs uses cookies to help Wear Your Own Techs identify and track visitors, their usage of Wear Your Own Techs website, and their website access preferences. Wear Your Own Techs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Wear Your Own Techs websites, with the drawback that certain features of Wear Your Own Techs websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
<br>
<br>Business Transfers
<br>If Wear Your Own Techs, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Wear Your Own Techs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Wear Your Own Techs may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
<br>

<br>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
